🚀 Innovative Gradio-Based Application for Extracting Insights from Feedback Responses

I’m excited to showcase my unique project — a Gradio-based application that I personally created to extract valuable insights from feedback responses! 📋💡

🔍 Users simply upload feedback sheets, and the app processes the data to extract key parameters like "hands-on work", satisfaction levels, and more. The insights are visually represented with pie charts and bar charts, making it easy to see the overall trends. 📊

But the real standout is the automated PDF report! 📑 The first page provides a concise summary of all responses, offering a quick snapshot. The following pages dive into detailed insights with donut charts for each key parameter, such as percentage breakdowns for aspects like hands-on experience, giving a clear visual of the data. 🍩

This one-of-a-kind project is designed to help teams dealing with large volumes of feedback by automating the analysis process. It saves time and delivers easy-to-read reports that highlight the most important insights — fast! ⏱️
